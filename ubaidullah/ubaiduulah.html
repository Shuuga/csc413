		Why do people prefer Cristiano Ronaldo as a role model over Lionel Messi?
I don't believe this to be true at all. Anyone that knows the game of football will know that lionel messi plays the game the correct way. He does not dive (especially in the box) to simply get on the score sheet. Lio plays the game with the focus of always going towards goal, he barely passes the ball backwards, nor does he waste his time doing step overs to try and beat only one player which in the end is a hard feat he can barely execute and in the end he will inevitably pass the ball backwards with a (no look back pass) to woah the crowd who are just star struck at his popularity. His style of play at Juventus stops the rhythm and flow of the game especially in current form.

At the end it is a matter of opinion and I guess players see Ronaldo as a level where football players can reach through hard work and dedication.

As for Lionel Messi, no one will be able to reach the level of genius and style of play he possesses, cause he’s not from this planet. Players have tried to copy his style and failed miserably after many have been given the title, ”the next Messi”, “Japanese Messi
